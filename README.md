## What is it?
Steam Buddy is a web based tool for installing non-Steam software to your Linux based couch gaming system. It was primarily developed for GamerOS.


## Features

### install flathub apps
A limited set of applications from flathub are available for immediate installation. This set of applications will be expanded over time.


### upload roms

You can upload roms and banner images to Steam Buddy and they will be added to Steam. The emulators are pre-configured and ready to play out of the box with almost any controller.

The following platforms are currently supported:
- Game Boy
- Game Boy Advance
- Game Boy Color
- Game Gear
- Genesis/Mega Drive
- Master System
- Nintendo
- Super Nintendo

More platforms will be added over time.


## Instructions
Steam Buddy is available and running on GamerOS by default. You can connect to it by opening a browser on another computer not running GamerOS and entering `gameros.local`. If that does not work, then determine the ip address of your GamerOS system by looking at the network settings. Then enter the ip address as is into your browser.

After installing any app, you must restart Steam for the application to appear.
To restart Steam you can click on the cog icon in the top right of the Steam Buddy UI and select the "Restart Steam" option.
